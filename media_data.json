The land was scrub pine forest that had failed already as an industrial development. The sales price was $1.75 million. State regulations prohibited Jim McDougal from investing more than 6% of his Madison Guaranty S&L assets. So, he put in $600,000 of Madison money and then for the difference had Seth Ward put in the remaining $1.15 million. This money Ward borrowed from Madison Guaranty on non-recourse, no personal obligation to repay. If federal regulators found out, McDougal's S&L could be shut down, since it had already been operating under orders to correct its lending practices.",

Some viewed the organizatioin as part of a \"network of coercive and partisan institutions,\" in a concerted effort to present a more favorable view of the country to the outside world and to control the flow of information nationally. The New York Times reported in 1964 that most of the agency's news came from Reuters ; the agency functioned as a gatekeeper in that it disseminated international news to the Ghanaian press, and deleted any international news critical of the Ghanaian leadership immediately, thus preventing such news from reaching the country's newspapers and radio stations. Until the rise of the Pan African News Agency, the GNA was considered one of the most efficient news agencies in Africa, spreading what Nkrumah called the \"clear ideology of the African Revolution\" and contributing to \"African and Ghanaian emancipation.\"",
